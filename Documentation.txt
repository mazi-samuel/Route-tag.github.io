## Installation

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files
2. Ensure all assets (images) are in the correct `/images` directory
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser

## Usage

This is a static website that serves as a marketing page for the Routag mobile application. Users can:

1. Learn about the platform's features
2. Understand how it works for both senders and couriers
3. Download the mobile app through the provided links

## Responsive Considerations

The HTML includes responsive meta tags:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```

However, the actual responsive behavior would be implemented in the accompanying CSS file (`style.css`).

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Responsiveness**: More robust mobile layouts
2. **Interactive Elements**: JavaScript functionality for better user engagement
3. **Form Integration**: Contact or signup forms
4. **Animation**: Subtle animations for better user experience
5. **Accessibility**: Improved ARIA attributes and contrast ratios
6. **Performance Optimization**: Image optimization and lazy loading

## Conclusion

The Routag landing page effectively communicates the platform's value proposition to both senders and couriers. The clean design with clear sections guides users through the information hierarchy, culminating in clear calls-to-action for app downloads. The project demonstrates solid HTML structure and would benefit from the responsive CSS implementation to complete the user experience.
